- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZakMorrison2024
- I mainly just do this for fun, my main focus is my games.
- Been programming for 20+ years. [ ... GML (Best) ... Python (Advanced) ... C++ (Arduino: Better) ... Javascript (Basic) ... C# (Basic) ... ]
- I HATE GML ¬¬ Soz babes, luvs us reali uwu <3 RAWR <3 ... but Python is much better... ¬¬
- Feel free to take anything on here. I won't post anything I plan on selling anyway.
- I have recently fallen in-love with GitHub!
- I use it as a library where I can store and share good ideas and my scripts.
- Always improving. Learning something new. :D
- I credit GPT and any scripts I've saved. I need to go over some and credit GPT ...
- My code is open to interpretation :L hence the lack of comments ... :L
- I'm just lazy. ¬¬
- I will eventually go over everything, to make sure a ReadMe.md is properly assigned.
- HEHEHEHE 40+ repos and nothing works :L
- I really need to fix this backlog ¬¬
- I fear not the basilisk, for technology is the product of my very nature and spirit!
