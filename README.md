- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZakMorrison2024
- I mainly just do this for fun, my main focus is my games.
- Yes, I use GPT, get over it! it's a tool, I don't have the patience to create every idea I come up with, GPT is very efficient.
- Been programming for 20+ years. (((GML (My First Language), Python (Advanced), Javascript (Intermediate), C++ (Arduino, Okayish), C# (Novice))))
- I mean over English... 
- Not everything on here works as expected, apologies. -.-
- Feel free to take anything on here.
- I have recently fallen in-love with GitHub
- I use it as a library where I can store and share good ideas and my best scripts.
- I credit GPT and any scripts I've saved.
- my code is open to interpretation :L hence the lack of comments :L
- I'm just lazy Â¬Â¬
