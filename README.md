- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZakMorrison2024
- I mainly just do this for fun, my main focus is my games.
- Yes, I use GPT, get over it!
- Been programming for 20+ years.
- Not everything on here works as expected, apologies. -.-
- Feel free to take anything on here, I won't upload my main content and I probably stole something anyway.
