- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZakMorrison2024
- I mainly just do this for fun, my main focus is my games.
- Yes, I use GPT, get over it! it's a tool, I don't have the patience to create every idea I come up with, GPT is very efficient. (On this note, I'm still debugging some stuff!!)
- Been programming for 20+ years. [ ... GML (Best) ... Python (Advanced) ... C++ (Arduino: Better) ... Javascript (Basic) ... C# (Basic) ... ]
- I HATE GML Â¬Â¬ Soz babes, luvs us reali uwu <3 RAWR <3 ... but Python is much better... Â¬Â¬
- Feel free to take anything on here. I won't post anything I plan on selling anyway.
- I have recently fallen in-love with GitHub!
- I use it as a library where I can store and share good ideas and my scripts.
- Always improving. Learning something new. :D
- I credit GPT and any scripts I've saved. I need to go over some and credit GPT ...
- My code is open to interpretation :L hence the lack of comments ... :L
- I'm just lazy. Â¬Â¬
- I will eventually go over everything, to make sure a ReadMe.md is properly assigned.
- HEHEHEHE 40 repos and nothing works :L
- I really need to fix this backlog Â¬Â¬
